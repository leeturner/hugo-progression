# Hugo Progression TODO:

* Allow the use of custom css via specifying the css files as a site property
* The template doesn't work all that well when the site is being rendered into a sub-folder of the main site
* When a progression framework `yml` file has no data for a particular level the headings are output without any bullet points.  See here on the demo site - https://hugo-progression.com/operations/ops-leadership/
