# Hugo Progression
Hugo Progression is a [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) template that can render progression frameworks using the same data format as the [Monzo progression framework](https://github.com/monzo/progression-framework)

## What Are Progression Frameworks ?

A progression framework (or ‚Äòcompetency matrix‚Äô, ‚Äòcareer ladder‚Äô, ‚Äòcareer pathway‚Äô) is a tool to help people within an organisation understand where they currently are and how to progress and grow in their work.  It also helps an organisation map people's competencies (their skills and knowledge) to compensation (how they're rewarded for them financially).

When done right, a tool like this helps employees to grow and hone their strengths, and helps managers ensure that their organisations are in good shape and their employees happy.

## How To Build Your Progression Framework With Hugo Progression

Everything discussed here can be found in the [`exampleSite`](https://github.com/leeturner/hugo-progression/tree/main/exampleSite) folder within this repository.

### 1) Installation

Navigate to your themes folder in your Hugo site and use the following commands:

```
cd themes/
git clone https://github.com/leeturner/hugo-progression.git
```

If you don't want to clone the theme you can add it as a git submodule. Inside the folder of your Hugo site run:

```
git submodule add https://github.com/leeturner/hugo-progression.git themes/hugo-progression
```

For more information read the [official setup guide](https://gohugo.io/overview/installing/) of Hugo.

### 2) Setup Your Framework Data & Content

Due to some restrictions in what data `hugo` allows in the markdown front matter along with how you reference data files in `hugo`, an individual framework needs to consist of 3 things:

* a markdown page that contains the homepage of the framework
* a data `yml` file containing the content for each level of the framework
* a hugo html partial that links the above together.

```
+-----------+       +------------+       +------------+          +-------------+
| Markdown  |       |    html    |       |  data yml  |          | Individual  |
|   file    |------>|   partial  |------>|    file    |     =    | Progression |
|           |       |            |       |            |          |  Framework  |
+-----------+       +------------+       +------------+          +-------------+
```

#### 2.1) Create Your Framework Data Files

In this step we will create the `hugo` data file that contains the data for the different areas and levels for an individual framework.  These data files are `yml` and follow the same format as the Monzo data files.  A partial example of one of these data files is included below:

```yaml
topics:
  - name: "communication"
    title: "üí¨ Communication"
    content:
      - level: 1
        criteria:
          - "Provides regular status updates to their mentor/buddy"
          - "Points out syntactical improvements in code reviews"
          - "Writes PR descriptions that provide basic context for the change"
          - "Seeks guidance from other engineers, rather than answers"
      - level: 2
        criteria:
          - "Proactively communicates to their team what they are working on, why, how it's going and what help they need"
          - "Accepts feedback graciously"
          - "Gives feedback to peers when asked"
        exampleCriteria:
          - criteria: "Provides helpful and actionable feedback in code reviews in an empathetic manner"
            examples:
              - "Take a look at the levelling up your code reviews talk for some ideas"
          - criteria: "Writes PR descriptions that provide context and provide rationale for significant decisions"
            examples:
              - "I decided to X instead of Y here, I also considered Z but for these reasons I went with X"
  - name: "impact"
    title: "üí• Impact"
    content:
      - level: 1
        criteria:
          - "Delivers assigned tasks, working with a more senior team member, and able to take PR feedback to improve their work"
      - level: 2
        criteria:
          - "Delivers assigned tasks that meet expected criteria"
          - "Works for the team, focuses on tasks that contribute to team goals"
          - "Tries to unblock themselves first before seeking help"
          - "Manages their own time effectively, prioritises their workload well, on time for meetings, aware when blocking others and unblocks"
          - "Helps the team, does what needs doing"
          - "Breaks down small/medium problems into iterative steps"
```

These framework data files need to be placed in the `data` folder for your `hugo` site.  They can be structured into sub-folders if you wish:

```
data
  frameworks
    engineering
      backend.yml
      data.yml
      mobile.yml
      qualityanalyst.yml
      web.yml
    operations
      opsindividualcontributor.yml
      opsleadership.yml
    generic.yml
    marketing.yml
    people.yml
    product.yml
```

See the examples in the `exampleSite` folder if you want to see more complete examples.

#### 2.2) Create The Markdown Page With Front Matter & Content For The Framework Homepage

For any of the frameworks to appear in your `hugo` site you will need a markdown file that contains the correct front matter and the content for the homepage of the individual framework.  The front matter can contain all the usual `hugo` fields along with a couple of special fields specific to `hugo-progression`.  See the example below:

```markdown
---
title: üõ†Ô∏è Backend Engineering Framework
linktitle: üõ†Ô∏è Backend
description: Backend engineering progression framework
menu:
  main:
    parent: engineering
levels: 6
datafilepartial: engineering/backend-partial.html
---
```

The two fields that are specific to `hugo-progression` are `levels` and `datafilepartial`.  The `levels` field specifies how many levels there are in this individual framework which must correspond to the number of levels in your framework `yml` data file.  This will also determine how many levels are created in the menu when the site is generated:

![Hugo Progression Levels](https://github.com/leeturner/hugo-progression/blob/main/images/hugo-progression-levels.png "Hugo Progression Levels")

The `datafilepartial` field links the markdown file to the specific html partial for this individual framework.  We will create this html partial in the next step

#### 2.3) Create The HTML Partial 

Because `hugo` won't allow us to specify a data file in the front matter of a markdown file we have to create a simple `hugo` html partial file for each framework data file to get around this.  If you want to understand more about this restriction in `hugo` take a look at this article by [Michele Titolo](https://michele.io/) which helped me understand how to work around it - https://michele.io/content-data-hugo/

I have tried to take out all the common elements make sure the html partial files are as small as possible, and the below example is as small as I could get it. 

```gotemplate
{{ $this_parent_index := .parent_index}}
{{ range .site_data.frameworks.engineering.backend.topics }}
{{ partial "topic-by-level.html" (dict "context" . "parent_index" $this_parent_index) }}
{{ end }}
```

As you can see, the one line that is specific to the data file is the `range` line:

```gotemplate
{{ range .site_data.frameworks.engineering.backend.topics }}
```

This line will change for each of the html partial files but all the rest will stay the same.  The path to the `topics` effectively matches the folder structure you used when you created your data files. To keep things consistent I store my html partials in the same directory structure as my data files:

```
layouts
  partials
    engineering
      backend-partial.html
      data-partial.html
      mobile-partial.html
      qualityanalyst-partial.html
      web-partial.html
    operations
      opsindividualcontributor-partial.html
      opsleadership-partial.html
    generic-partial.html
    marketing-partial.html
    people-partial.html
    product-partial.html
```

Once you have created your html partial file that references the framework data file, make sure you are correctly referencing the html partial in your markdown file as in the example above:

```markdown
---
datafilepartial: engineering/backend-partial.html
---
```
