## What Are Progression Frameworks ?

A progression framework (or ‘competency matrix’, ‘career ladder’, ‘career pathway’) is a tool to help people within an organisation understand where they currently are and how to progress and grow in their work.  It also helps an organisation maps people's competencies (their skills and knowledge) to compensation (how they're rewarded for them financially).

When done right, a tool like this helps employees to grow and hone their strengths, and helps managers ensure that their organisations are in good shape and their employees happy.
