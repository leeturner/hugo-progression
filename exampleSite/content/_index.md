This is where we keep the progression frameworks we use at Dummy Co.

Progression frameworks are tools that help us evaluate and pay our staff consistently, and help people understand how to progress in their work.

We've put them here for everyone at Dummy Co (and anyone in the world!) to use.

We'll be adding more frameworks as we build them, and updating existing ones as we grow, so expect things to change around here!

This site, along with all our progression frameworks, are open source. That means you can contribute to the development of this site or our progression frameworks, and use both as inspiration for your own projects!

To get involved, go to

@monzo/progression-framework.

You can find out more about progression at Dummy Co and what it means for us in this blog post.

Take a look around and let us know what you think! üöÄ
